# Haskell-Fractals

**Obsolete**: I'm working on a new modularised version: [Haskell-Fractal-Graphics](https://github.com/lollobaldo/Haskell-Fractal-Graphics) .

Haskell fractal graphic program for the functional programming competition. All variables are editable at the top of the file. I know it's messy and there's dead code, but I'm not maintaining it anymore as I'm working on a new verison.

Every part of the picture is made by a recursive function or similar:

The tree is a [Pythagoras tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal)) with varying angle. It has a depth of 10

The snow is a [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) build as a [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

The sun is a recursive star with varying size and colour.

The grass is kinda recursive.

The cloud -- well, still working on it.

**Obviously** this is only a GIF, the program has much better quality.
